# 2026-02-21 – LEFT JOIN

## Concept
LEFT JOIN keeps all rows from the left table.
If no match exists → NULL.

## Why Used
Problem required keeping all persons,
even if they don’t have an address.

## SQL

SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;

## Real-World Insight
In marketing data,
not all users have conversion data.
LEFT JOIN prevents losing those users.
