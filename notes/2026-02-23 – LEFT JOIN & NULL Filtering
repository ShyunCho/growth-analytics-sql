2026-02-23 – LEFT JOIN & NULL Filtering

What I Learned

LEFT JOIN
Keeps all rows from the left table.
If no match exists in the right table → values become NULL.

Example:
Visits: 1 2 3
Transactions: 1 2

LEFT JOIN result:
1 → matched
2 → matched
3 → NULL

NULL Filtering
When using LEFT JOIN, unmatched rows contain NULL in the joined table.
To find non-matching rows:
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL

GROUP BY
Groups rows by a specific column.
Used here to count how many non-transaction visits each customer had.

COUNT(*)
Counts rows within each group.

Problem Practiced

LeetCode 1581 – Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions

SELECT
  v.customer_id,
  COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
  ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;

Key Insight

LEFT JOIN keeps all visits.
Unmatched rows become NULL.
Filtering NULL finds non-converting visits.
GROUP BY + COUNT calculates how many times each customer failed to convert.

Business Connection:
Counts visits with zero transactions → non-converting traffic.
Core logic for funnel drop-off and conversion rate analysis.
